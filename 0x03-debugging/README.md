## Tasks
[0-main.c](0-main.c) - In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:<br/><br/>
[1-main.c](1-main.c) - Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code. You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.<br/><br/>
[2-largest_number](2-largest_number)- This program prints the largest of three integers.<br/
>

[3-print_remaining_days.c](3-print_remaining_days.c) - This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
